# Different kinds of React Components

React comes bundled with two different types of components: **Class Components** and **Function Components**.

## Class Components

- Were introduced by the first version of React (circa 2012)
- Always extends from base class `React.Component`
- Has special class properties
  - `this.state` (Integrated state)
  - `this.props` (Passed properties to this component)
- Has special methods
  - `render()`
  - `this.setState()`
  - `componentDidMount()`
  - ...

```tsx
import * as React from 'react';

class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return null;
  }
}
```

## Function Components

- Introduced with React `v0.14` in 2015, now the de-facto standard to write React Components
- Are simple JavaScript functions that return JSX
- No state included

```tsx
function MyComponent(props) {
  return null;
}
```

Or with better Typings:

```tsx
import * as React from 'react';

// React.FC is the short form for React.FunctionComponent
const MyComponent: React.FC = (props) => {
  return null;
};
```
